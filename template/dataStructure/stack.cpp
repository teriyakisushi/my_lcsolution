/*
Stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
We use std::stack in C++ to implement a stack.
It has the following main functions:
    1. push(): Add an element to the top of the stack.
    2. pop(): Remove the top element from the stack.
    3. top(): Get the top element of the stack.
    4. empty(): Check if the stack is empty.
    5. size(): Get the number of elements in the stack.
